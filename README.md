## Overview

**AmeliaTF** is a large transformer-based trajectory forecasting model that aims to characterize relevant **airport surface movement** operations from the [Amelia-48](https://ameliacmu.github.io/amelia-dataset/) dataset.

To do so, our model comprises three main submodules:

1. A **scene representation** module that determines the agents of interest in the scene using a scoring strategy, and encodes per-agent features,
2. A transformer-based **scene encoder**, which hierarchically encodes the temporal, agent-to-agent and agent-to-context relationships within a scene, and;
3. A **trajectory decoder** that models the set of possible futures with associated confidence scores using a Gaussian Mixture Model.

</p>

We explore different scene representation and training experiments for our model varying from **single-airport** to **multi-airport** settings in which we assess our modelâ€™s generalization capabilities. In the subsequent sections we provide details on how to reproduce our experiments. For further details, please check out our paper!

## Pre-requisites

### Dataset

To run this repository, you first need to download the amelia dataset. Follow the instructions [here](https://ameliacmu.github.io/amelia-dataset/) to download the dataset.

Once downloaded, create a symbolic link into  `datasets`:

```bash
cd datasets
ln -s /path/to/amelia .
```

### Installation

Make sure that you have [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed.

**Recommended:** Use the  [`install.sh`](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/blob/main/install.sh) to download and install the Amelia Framework:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh amelia
```

This will create a conda environment named `amelia` and install all dependencies.

Alternatively, refer to [`INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for manual installation.

**Note:** AmeliaTF requires the Amelia dataset and AmeliaScenes' dependencies to run, refer to AmeliaScenes' and AmeliaTF's installation.

#### Scenario Pre-processing

Once you've downloaded the dataset and installed the required modules. You need to post-process the dataset. To do so, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/blob/main/README.md).

#### Additional Notes

Our repository's structure is based on this [template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template), which uses Hydra and Pytorch Lightning. We recommend going through their [README](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template?tab=readme-ov-file#your-superpowers) for further details into the code's functionalities.

## How to use

Activate your amelia environment (**Please make sure to follow the pre-requisites guidelines above above**):

```bash
conda activate amelia
```

### Training a Model

The general format for running a training experiment is:

```bash
python src/train.py data=<data_config> model=<model_config> trainer=<trainer_config>
```

where:

- `<data_config>`, represents a dataset configuration specified under `./configs/data`
- `<model_config>`, represents a model configuration specified under `./configs/model`
- `<trainer_config>`, represents the trainer to be used, (e.g., CPU, GPU, DDP, etc), specified under `./configs/trainer`

For example, to train our model on GPU using all of our currently supported airports, you would run:

```bash
python src/train.py data=seen-all model=marginal trainer=gpu
```

### Evaluating a Model

If you already have a pre-trained checkpoint you can run evaluation only using `eval.py` and following a similar format as above. However, you need to provide the path to the pre-trained weights. For example,

```bash
python src/eval.py data=seen-all model=marginal trainer=gpu ckpt_path=/path/to/pretrained/weights.ckpt
```

### Our experiments

We provide the configuration combination to run our experiments, as well as our pre-trained weights.

#### Other Experiments

- We trained our models under a **marginal** prediction setting, but we have support for training models on a **joint** prediction setting. To change the prediction paradigm, change the model parameter to `joint`. For example:

```bash
python src/train.py data=seen-all model=joint trainer=gpu
```

- Our model can be trained with and without context (maps). To train the trajectory-only model, use either `marginal_traj` or `joint_traj` configurations. For example,

```bash
python src/train.py data=seen-all model=marginal_traj trainer=gpu
```
