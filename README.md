## Overview

**AmeliaTF** is a large transformer-based trajectory forecasting model that aims to characterize relevant **airport surface movement** operations from the [Amelia-48](https://ameliacmu.github.io/amelia-dataset/) dataset.

To do so, our model comprises three main submodules:

1. A **scene representation** module that determines the agents of interest in the scene using a scoring strategy, and encodes per-agent features,
2. A transformer-based **scene encoder**, which hierarchically encodes the temporal, agent-to-agent and agent-to-context relationships within a scene, and;
3. A **trajectory decoder** that models the set of possible futures with associated confidence scores using a Gaussian Mixture Model.

</p>

We explore different scene representation and training experiments for our model varying from **single-airport** to **multi-airport** settings in which we assess our modelâ€™s generalization capabilities. In the subsequent sections we provide details on how to reproduce our experiments. For further details, please check out our paper!

## Pre-requisites

### Installation

#### Basic Setup

First, install **Amelia-Scenes**. Here are the [instructions](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/INSTALL.md).

Then, install **AmeliaTF**: Activate the environment created during the **Amelia-Scenes** setup:

```bash
conda activate amelia
```

Download the GitHub repository and install requirements:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AmeliaCMU/AmeliaTF.git
cd AmeliaTF
pip install -e .
```

#### Full Setup

If you're interested in using all of our [tools](https://ameliacmu.github.io/amelia-dataset/), you can install our framework through this [script](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/install.sh).

### Dataset

To run this repository, you first need to download the amelia dataset. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/DATASET.md) to download and setup the dataset.

Once downloaded, create a symbolic link into  ```datasets```:

```bash
cd datasets
ln -s /path/to/the/amelia/dataset .
```

### Scenario Pre-processing

Once you've downloaded the dataset and installed the required modules. You need to post-process the dataset. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/README.md).

### Additional Notes

Our repository's structure is based on this [template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template), which uses Hydra and Pytorch Lightning. We recommend going through their [README](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template?tab=readme-ov-file#your-superpowers) for further details into the code's functionalities.

## How to use

Activate your amelia environment (**Please make sure to follow the pre-requisites guidelines above above**):

```bash
conda activate amelia
```

### Training a Model

The general format for running a training experiment is:

```bash
python src/train.py data=[data_config] model=[model_config] trainer=[trainer_config]
```

where:

- ```[data_config]```, represents a dataset configuration specified under ```./configs/data```
- ```[model_config]```, represents a model configuration specified under ```./configs/model```
- ```[trainer_config]```, represents the trainer to be used, (e.g., CPU, GPU, DDP, etc), specified under ```./configs/trainer```

For example, to train our model on GPU using all of our currently supported airports, you would run:

```bash
python src/train.py data=seen-all model=marginal trainer=gpu
```

### Evaluating a Model

If you already have a pre-trained checkpoint you can run evaluation only using `eval.py` and following a similar format as above. However, you need to provide the path to the pre-trained weights. For example,

`bash
python src/eval.py data=seen-all model=marginal trainer=gpu ckpt_path=/path/to/pretrained/weights.ckpt
`

### Our experiments

We provide the configuration combination to run our experiments, as well as our pre-trained weights.

#### Other Experiments

- We trained our models under a **marginal** prediction setting, but we have support for training models on a **joint** prediction setting. To change the prediction paradigm, change the model parameter to `joint`. For example:

```bash
python src/train.py data=seen-all model=joint trainer=gpu
```

- Our model can be trained with and without context (maps). To train the trajectory-only model, use either `marginal_traj` or `joint_traj` configurations. For example,

```bash
python src/train.py data=seen-all model=marginal_traj trainer=gpu
```
